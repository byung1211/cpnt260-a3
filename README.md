	There is no bugs that I have faced, but some difficuties to make the gallery look like the gallery of Pixels.com at the beginning. I have spent quite a lot of time, but I realized I could not make without using a javascript framework because the different heights of the images. Long story to short, I just tried to make sure to meet the assignment instructions. In my view, Css is all about look and feel and it requires artistic creativity. In that point, I am not sure that I am good at it. At least, I tried wigh my best.
